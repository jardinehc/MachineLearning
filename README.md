Using machine learning to predict how many minutes a flight will depart from its scheduled departure time. Many common techniques will be studied to see which will provide the best and most accurate models. The top three options will be created, and the results recorded.
This will allow travellers to make informed decisions regarding their air travel to ensure they get to their destination in a way most efficient to them.  

Historic data from the month of January in 2019 is collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (United States Department of Transportation, 2019). This data provides accurate and official information regarding all commercial flight information to and from New Jersey during the specified time period. Using this information an evaluation can describe the delays between airports with each airline and the cause.
This will include the month (for testing purposes this is all January), day of month (1-31), flight number, destination city, origin city, number of minutes of delay (negative vale for early departures), reason for cancellation (if application) and number of minutes of delay caused by specific reasons. 

Microsoft Azure Notebook is a free, online program which facilitates Jupyter development and thus the creation of interactive graphics. Jupyter uses python in a command line style GUI. When code is entered it is run using the ‘Run’ option and it is executed. Scikit-learn will be used to build a machine learning model. Scikit-learn is a machine learning and data mining, open-source library which utilizes Python to compare and validate models in order to achieve accuracy in modelling. Matplotlib will be used to visualize the model, again utilizing Python.
